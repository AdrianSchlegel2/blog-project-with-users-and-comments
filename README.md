# blog project with users and comments
 Another upgraded version of my blog website with the ability to add users and comments. I added the ability for each user to create an own account which details will be saved in an **SQL Database**. The password which will be saved will be hashed and salted using the **werkzeug tool**. I also added 2 more tables which store the comments as well as blog posts of the users. However, to actually understand which blog and comment is owned by which user, I added **one to many relationships (one parent class (user) has many children (blog posts or comments))**. I also added each users personal icon, by using the **Gravatar API**, which gives each user a specific and unique icon depending on their email address. Apart from that I also created a decorater function called *@admin_only* which would only allow the admin (meaning the first signed up user of the blogsite) to access specific routes.
If you want to use this website for yourself you should completely delete the database which is present in these files and let the program run. From there on you can create your own users, posts as well as comments.
